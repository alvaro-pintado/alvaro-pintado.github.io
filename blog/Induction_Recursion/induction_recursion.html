        <p> Simply put, induction principles allow you to <i>prove</i> certain theorems and recursion principles allow you to <i>construct</i> objects in a certain way. The relation between the two is that for every recursively defined set of objects there is a corresponding induction principle for the set of objects which allows you to prove theorems about those objects inductively. So defintiions by recursion allow for proofs by induction. I will try to do this in full generality and describe common examples.  </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Recursion</h2>

        <p> Let \( G\subset U \) be some set which I'll call the 'generating set' and a function \( f:U\rightarrow U  \). Intuitively, \( f\) is an object-building function which allows you to build more complicated objects from the initial generating set \( G \). This can be generalized to more than one function of higher arities, but I think a single unary function suffices to explain the concepts. Now let \(\overline{G}\) be the set of elements in \(U\) that can be obtained by a finite number of applications of \(f\)  (closure of \(G\) under \(f\)). </p>

        <p> <b>Example.</b>
            A simple example of such a set is we can take \(U\) to be the set of all expressions in the language of propositional logic (PL), \( G \) to be the set of atomic propositions, and the function \(f\) to be the negation function which takes in an expression of PL and outputs the expression with a negation in front of it. For this example, \( \overline{G} \) is the set of all propositions with some finite amount of negations (possibly 0). One can add more functions here such as AND, OR, and so on to make \( \overline{G} \) the set of all well-formed formulas in propositional logic.
        </p>

        <p> OK so now we have \( G \) which is our set of recursively defined objects. Suppose now that we want to define a function on our set of recursively defined objects  \( G \) but in a way that uses the recursive definition of the objects. What I mean is that we want \(h\) that  </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Induction</h2>

        <p>
            The princple of induction can be extended to any set with a well-founded relation. special case: transfinite induction, nat number induction
