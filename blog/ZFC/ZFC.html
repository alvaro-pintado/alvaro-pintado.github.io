                    Some Easy Questions about ZFC</h1>
        
                <p>
                    I am currently reading Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs by Kunen for my independent study in set theory. My professor gave me the assignment of determining which axioms of ZFC held in \( \omega \).</p>
                <p>
                    While working on this, I started to think about what would happen if we interpreted the membership relation as a strict partial order in the ZFC axioms. Are there any models under this interpretation? Does \( \mathbb{N} \) as a strict total order satisfy these axioms? </p>
                <p>
                    The two interpretations I considered of the membership relation were a strict partial order and the directed edge relation. Part of my motivation for thinking about different interpretations of ZFC was that it might be a helpful perspective in figuring out which statements are undecidable.</p>
                <p>    
                    The results arenâ€™t interesting so far. There do not seem to be any models under the two interpretations I considered. Nonetheless, it was an interesting project. I also believe it helped me understand the axioms much better. <a href="Some Questions about ZFC.pdf">This</a> is the draft of my write-up on these questions.</p>
