                    <p>This was basic research I did while still an electrical engineering and computer science major at UNLV. This was funded research I did under the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UNLV. </p>
                   
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Internet of Battle Things</h2>

                    <p>Simply put, Internet of Battle Things is the concept of Internet of Things applied to a military setting. Often the term 'network-centric warfare' is used as well. It is the future of warfare.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even though network-centric warfare is not a reality yet, research is being done to begin thinking about how IoT can be leveraged by the military.</p>

                    <p> <a href=""><i>Leveraging the Internet of Things for a More Efficient and Effective Military</i></a> is a great publication that proposes ways in which the military can leverage IoT.  </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Research Summary</h2>

                    <p> My research was specifically in the problem of supply support. The supply support problem is the problem of allocating resources to different units in a battlefield setting.</p>

                    <p> My solution was to partition the battlefield into regions with something like a k-means clustering algorithm. This was to be done by a central authority unit. In every region, there are a number of supply requests by units in the battlefield. The support requests were represented with an ordered-tuple quanitifying how much of various types of resources the unit needed. </p>  
                    
                    <p> The supply vehicles would engage in a coalition game, that is, they would try and form coalitions to maximize the fullfillment of support requests in the different regions of the battlefield. Each supply vehicle calculated the potential payoff it could receive if it chose to supply a given region. The payoff function was essentially a measure of how well the fit was between a supply vehicle and a supply request. Having each vehicle calculate its own payoff per region allows for the benefits of distributed computing.  </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Side Note</h2>

                    <p>Due to personal matters at the time, I was not able to finish the research. I had developed algorithms and utility functions, but was unable to perform expriments. Another student was able to pickup where I left off and run some simulations. You can find my name in the Acknolwedgements Section. </p>
