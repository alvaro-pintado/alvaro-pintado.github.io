            <p>I completed my master's at UPenn, where I was a <a href="https://bridge.math.upenn.edu/meet-our-students/" target="_blank" >Bridge to PhD Fellow</a>, and my undergraduate in mathematics at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). While at UNLV, I also developed a strong interest in philosophy and sat in on numerous philosophy courses.  </p>

            <p> I am interested broadly in mathematical logic, the foundations of math, and philosophical logic. </p>

            ``The development of mathematics toward greater precision has led, as is well known, to the formalization of large tracts of it, so that one can prove any theorem using nothing but a few mechanical rules. The most comprehensive formal systems that have been set up hitherto are the system of Principia Mathematica on the one hand and the Zermelo-Frankel axiom system of set theory (further developed by J. von Neumann) on the other. These two systems are so comprehensive that in them all methods of proof today used in mathematics are formalized, that is, reduced to a few axioms and rules of inference. One might therefore conjecture that these axioms an rules of inference are sufficient to decide any mathematica question that can at all be formally expressed in these systems. It will be show below that this is not the case... ''
