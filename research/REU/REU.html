                <p>Directed algebraic topology is the generalization of algebraic topology to the
                    setting of directed topological spaces—spaces equipped with a notion of directionality (intuitively understood
                    as the flow of time). Studying irreversible paths on topological spaces has applications in modeling irreversible
                    phenomena, most notably in concurrent programming. There are competing ideas regarding how homology
                    should be defined in the directed setting. Under the guidance of Dr. Sanjeevi Krishnan and alongside a peer
                    research partner, I worked on a theory of directed homology proposed by Dr. Krishnan. My project investigated
                    Dr. Krishnan’s proposed definition. </p>

                <p> I would like to find the time to come back and write something fresh here, but for now I will simply link the <a href="#">draft</a> of a write-up summarizing the work I did during the REU and an image of the poster my research partner and I made for the 2019 Young Mathematician's Conference.  </p>
