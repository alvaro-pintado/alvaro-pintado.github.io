        <p>Directed algebraic topology is the generalization of algebraic topology to the
            setting of directed topological spaces—spaces equipped with a notion of directionality (intuitively understood
            as the flow of time). Studying irreversible paths on topological spaces has applications in modeling irreversible
            phenomena, most notably in concurrent programming. There are competing ideas regarding how homology
            should be defined in the directed setting. Under the guidance of Dr. Sanjeevi Krishnan and alongside a peer
            research partner, I worked on a theory of directed homology proposed by Dr. Krishnan. My project investigated
            Dr. Krishnan’s proposed definition. </p>

        <p> I would like to find the time to come back and write something fresh here, but for now I will simply link the <a href="Directed Homology.pdf">draft</a> of a write-up summarizing the work I did during the REU and an image of the poster my research partner and I made for the Young Mathematician's Conference (2019).  </p>
