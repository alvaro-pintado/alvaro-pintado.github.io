    <h2>About </h2>
      <p>I am currently a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania. I hope to pursue a PhD in Mathematical Logic. </p>
    <h2>Blog</h2>
      <p> A creative outlet for interesting mathematics and philosophy. </p>
    <h2>Projects and Programming</h2>
      <p> These are some projects I have done over the years. A lot of these were done during my first two years of university when I was majoring in electrical engineering and computer science and part of the robotics research lab at UNLV.<br> <br>

      If I ever have the interest to do some projects, Iâ€™ll post them here.</p>
